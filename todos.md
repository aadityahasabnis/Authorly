# Bugs
### Editor Bugs:

1. I cant see the accordion button in the toolbar .. -> I cant add the accordion in the editor _. but I can add through the / command popover _. see why the toolbar does not have the accordion button

2. the ctrl + A -> at first -> should select the block content -> after again ctrl + A (twice) -> should select all the blocks

3. If we select the content in the editor and copy, it selects all the unwanted properties -> it should select -> what types of block is it -> and what is the content.. -> right now, its selecting the color, text, padding, the icons too.. that is not wanted.. -> and while pasting -> it should paste -> accurately which tyle of block / content it was and the content itself -> by creating new blocks -> at where the cursor is..-> very professionally -> keeping mind all the other text that exists..

4. the ctrl + z -> undo is not working correctly -> ->  undo gets redirected to the first -> node /block in the editor -> and at the same time it updates all the values changed...-> in the editor -> the undo and the redu should be very very professionally build for the easiness -> in the editor usage

# TODO Implementations

1. If we write the - and (space) then the bullet list should start like the markdown -> and same for the number list 1. (space) -> in the block and for the quote use the > (space) that will start the quote 

2. like there are various blocks -> I want the Date to be added in teh content -> like in the / command too and in the toolbar at top too -> that will add the date -> to where the cursor is.. -> when we click on the -> date in the toolbar -> it should have the option to select from {today, tomorrow, yesterday} -> by default it will be todays.. -> and in the editor -> the date will be shown differently -> like the inline code -> fully formatted date [Fri, 17 July 2024] like this -> and when hover on the date -> it should have the option to select any date what is wanted -> from the calender -> and the calender -> should follow our styling patterns very professionally.. 

3. If we use #something -> in any where in the -> editor in any block or in any content -> then that #content should be styled differently -> in the light blue theme  -> like the inline code style -> but corners not that much rounded for the hashtag content ..

4. The image uploader and video uploader has bad UI's make the UI constant and minimal -> and very very professional -> 

5. Table of Contents _> should have the prop of the px. -> go to the content -> for top - {some px} because the conetnt comes at below the navbar at top.. (by default keep some constant like the 5 px)
​
6. ✅ download pdf option -> in the editor -> that will download the content into -> pdf -> in our styles -> with ------------ but if its going to make the package bulky then build our own pdf maker -> in our styles -> lightweight

7. ✅ Add the functionality -> that makes the selected content 1-> Lowercase, 2->Uppercase, 3-> Capitalize(each word -> first letter) -> and if there is already implemented the remove that functionality..ex-> If I selected the text and selected the -> Capitalize -> it Capitalize each word -> first letter -> but if I click again on the Capitalize, it should make them normal -> (like the vice versa) -> same for the Lowercase and Uppercase.. -> this should be implemented very professional manner -> on the toolbar -> only 1 button should be there -> after clicking on it -> it should open the 3 options popover -> for selecting what to choose -> between these 3 functions for the selected text.. the icons should be Aa <CaseSensitive /> -> -> implement this professionally -> like the link is implemented -> very professionally give correct name 

---

8. ✅ THe selected content (any type of content the editor->blocks) will have the -> some basic tools (absolute to what the content is selected) -> like the bold, italic, strikethrough, color, highlight, link, CaseSensitive, (in future AI edit) -> same like the word editor -> has the popover above the selected content -> those buttons will edit the content that is selected and return the pointer there only -> not get lost -> like the -> word or any high professional editor

# Future Scope (versions) [Not need to implement right now]

1. Add the Question and answer -> MCQ's or Select 2 or more for the corrrect and submit so see the result -> correct or false.. -> in the editor we should be able to add the questions -> and the correct answers to them.. (also add the explanation -> for those who selects the option wrongly) -> while rendering -> show the question and the options for that question -> which was added in the editor for that particular question -> dont show the answer -> user has to submit the answer by selecting -> either MCQ option or the multiple selects to fulfill the correct answer -> if the answer is correct -> then show the correct answer message and if the answer is incorrect show the correct answer and the explanation provided by the user who added the question and the explanation -> while writing the question and the options and the correct answer in the editor..

2. We should create the paste dump -> the content will be pasted and it will be rendered -> correctly in the editor blocks correctly and professionally (But before that we have to fix the format)

3. WE should implement the AI -> in this editor -> Scopes -> 1st scope - full document edit/enw content -> that will directly paste/render the content in the editor blocks according to our format -> by giving the icon[Button] on the toolbar and in the / command panel (But before that we have to fix the format) 2nd scope block wise AI editor -> just like the selected content to bold -> just like we have implemented the -> link for the selected content and popover for that link -> the selected content now

4. ✅ add feature to change the fonts -> for the selected content

5. ✅ Add feature to change the -> font size (increase or decrease the text font) -> of the selected text only -> like the link and the bold ..

6. ✅ integrate the Excalidraw -> see the reference for the integration from the -> and add the image as the image block


# Question and solutions:
### I have some questions -> and I want answers and your opinions:

Before the questions -> we all developer will be using this editor -> for the content to save in teh database and show that content on the page -> render the content -> on the page -> so the minimal content should be saved on the -> db -> in matter of size.. -> because if we store more content in the database -> the size of the database will increase fastly -> and this will be called the unoptimized method to store the date from the editor.

1. QUE1 - HOW ARE WE RENDERING THE IMAGES? -> IN THE PREVIEW I AM GETTING THE IMAGE RENDERED CCORRECTLY -> BUT IN RESPECT OF MANNER, HOW THIS -> WILL BE STORED IN THE DATABASE ???
MOST DEVELOPER USE THE LINKS -> 1. THEY CAN UPLOAD IT ON THE CLAUDINARY AND THEY GET THE LINK AND THEY ADD IT IN THE -> CONTENT.. -> HOW WE CAN DO THAT -> AND IMPLEMENT PROFESSIONALLY??
aNSWER THIS QUESTION HERE AND DONT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING UNLESS I CONFIRM IT TO..
